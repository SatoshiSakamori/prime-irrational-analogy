# Prime–Irrational Analogy

_A conceptual exploration by **Satoshi Sakamori**_

---

## 🧩 Overview

This repository presents a **conceptual analogy** between the distribution of **prime numbers** and the structure of **irrational numbers**.  

Both sets can be interpreted as **residual structures** that remain when all *regular, periodic, or rationally describable* subsets are systematically removed from the number line.

- **Primes**: remain after eliminating all periodic sets of multiples (via the sieve of Eratosthenes).  
- **Irrationals**: remain after removing all rational fractions (via rational partitions of the real line).

This idea was first described informally by Satoshi Sakamori and then expressed in LaTeX form as an initial working paper.

## 📄 Paper

The core note is written in LaTeX:

- [`prime_irrational_paper.tex`](./prime_irrational_paper.tex)
- [`prime_irrational_paper.pdf`](./prime_irrational_paper.pdf)

The PDF is a concise conceptual note intended to invite mathematical and philosophical discussion rather than present a formal theorem.

## 💡 Core Analogy

| Domain | Regular structure removed | Residual set | Interpretation |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| $\mathbb{N}$ (integers) | Multiples of smaller numbers (periodic sets) | Prime numbers | Multiplicative aperiodicity |
| $\mathbb{R}$ (reals) | Rational fractions $p/q$ (rational partitions) | Irrational numbers | Additive/rational aperiodicity |

Both can be seen as **non-periodic residues** of rational or modular orderings.

## 🔬 Future Work Ideas

1. Define an entropy-like measure of “irregularity” for the prime indicator function.  
2. Compare with the entropy of continued fraction coefficients of typical irrationals.  
3. Explore whether a shared measure of *rational deficiency* exists between $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{R}$.
